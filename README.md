# NCRF   
The magnetoencephalography (MEG) response to continuous auditory stimuli, such as speech, is commonly described using a linear filter, the auditory temporal response function (TRF). Though components of the sensor level TRFs have been well characterized, the cortical distributions of  the underlying neural responses are not well-understood. In our recent work, we provide a unified framework for determining the TRFs of neural sources directly from the MEG data, by integrating the TRF and distributed forward  source models into one, and casting the joint estimation task as a Bayesian optimization problem. Though the resulting  problem emerges as non-convex, we propose efficient solutions that leverage recent advances in evidence maximization. For more details please refer to [1], [2].

This repository contains the implementation of our direct TRF estimation algorithm in python (version 3.6 and above). 

## Requirements:
Eelbrain ([Download/ Installation Instructions](https://github.com/christianbrodbeck/Eelbrain/wiki/Installing#release))

## Installation
After successfully installing Eelbrain, one can follow either of the methods to install different versions the repository.   

### Installing the release version
The following comment will install the latest released version:
```commandline
pip install ncrf
```
Note: yet to be released on PyPI yet. 

### Development version from GitHub
Clone the GitHub repository and change the working directory:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/proloyd/neuro-currentRF.git
cd neuro-currentRF
```
Create an environment with the necessary dependencies (this assumes [Mamba](https://conda-forge.org/download/) is already installed): 

```commandline
mamba env create --file=env-dev.yml
```

Then, install neuro-currentRF in development model using pip:

```commandline
pip install -e .
```

Using a `-e` installation, changes in `*.py` files will be automatically reflected when you `import ncrf`.
Because Python caches imports, you may need to restart the kernel if you make changes after importing `ncrf`. 
Changes in compiled files (`*.pyx`, `*.c`, ...) will not be automatically reflects.
These require re-compilation (by running `pip install -e .` from the repository root folder).


## How to use:
run
```python
model = fit_ncrf(meg, stim, lead_field, noise, mu='auto', tstop=1.0, nlevels=2, n_splits=3, normalize='l1')
```
to perform a 3-fold cross-validation and then construct the model for 1s long TRF with the regularization weight among the given range that gives least generalization error. The signature of the ``meg`` and ``stim`` could be as follows:

    [        megA (case, sensor, time),                       megB (case, sensor, time),               ...]
    [[featA1 (case, time), featA2 (case, time), ...], [featB1 (case, time), featB2 (case, time), ...], ...]

For more options, please look at the docstring. The learned TRF, `h` can be retrieved using:
```python
h = model.h
```

## Results
We applied the algorithm on a subset of MEG data collected from 17 adults (aged 18-27 years) under an auditory task described in the papers. In short, during the task, the participants listened to `1 min` long segments from an audio-book recording of [The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving](https://librivox.org/the-legend-of-sleepy-hollow-by-washington-irving/), narrated by a male speaker. We consider localizing the TRFs using a total of `6 min` data from each participant. MNE-python 0.14 was used in pre-processing the raw data to automatically detect and discard flat channels, remove  extraneous artifacts, and to band-pass filter the data in the range `1 - 80 Hz`. The six `1 min` long data epochs were then down-sampled to `200 Hz`. As the stimulus variable, we used the speech envelope reflecting the momentary acoustic power, by averaging the auditory spectrogram representation (generated using a model of the 
auditory periphery) across the frequency bands, sampled at `200 Hz`.  A volume source space for individual subjects was defined on a 3D regular grid with a resolution of `7 mm` in each direction. The lead-field matrix was then computed by placing free orientation virtual dipoles on the resulting `3322` grid points. The consistent components of our estimated `1 s`-long 3D TRFs across all `17` subjects looks like following:

Isn't that cool? Do expect to see something like that with any other source localization method? If you realize you could use this method on your data, please feel free to use the codes. You can reach me at proloy@umd.edu if you have any issues with the codes. And don't forget to go over the papers/ posters before applying the algorithm.
